How do you want site visitors to interact with your site?

  I want them to be able to immediately access concise information about me. From there they will be access either a list of projects (available later on) or blog posts. The principle is easily accessed info.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

  On almost every page, my name, introduction, and contact info will be on the left.
  It will be obvious what to press to either reach blog posts or projects.
  Recent blog posts will also be accessible from the front page (rather than using the blog post list) - although in the future, I expect this to change to recent projects.
  Buttons will be provided so that users can return to the home page, or go the the next/previous blog post/project.
  I will be experimenting further with Google's material design, as it is considered a largely accessible and well designed component framework.
